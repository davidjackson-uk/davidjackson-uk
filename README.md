- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @davidjackson-uk, a PhD student based at *Manchester Metropolitan University* in the UK.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in **coding for academic writing and analysis**, big data processing using AI and anything to do with using data to inform people management decisions.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Markup, Linux server administration (Ubuntu 20.04) and using Markdown with Plandoc. I'm also fiddling about with MS Visual Code and various other bits and pieces.
