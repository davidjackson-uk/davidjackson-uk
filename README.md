# Hello World!
- 👋 Hi, I’m @davidjackson-uk, a management consultant and researcher based in the UK.
- 👀 I’m interested in **coding for academic writing and analysis**, **coding for qualitative data analysis and organisation** and anything to do with manipulating and reporting complex data to inform people's management decisions.
- 🌱 I’m currently developing my Python skills, Linux server administration and using Markdown with Pandoc. I'm also spending a lot of time in vanilla Emacs, BASH scripting and various other bits and pieces.

# Free Software
I am a supporting member of the [Free Software Foundation](https://www.fsf.org/) and so prioritise free software and its principles whenever I can. 

I do use proprietary software where my clients require it, and run non-free drivers where not doing so would mean throwing out perfectly good hardware. 😧 

📱 **Cell phone technology**
I am a user and supporter of [Graphene OS](https://grapheneos.org/) (running on Google Pixel 6 hardware).

🖥️ **Desktop computing**
Is on GNU/Linux Mint.

💻 **Laptop computing**
Is on GNU/Linux Fedroa.
